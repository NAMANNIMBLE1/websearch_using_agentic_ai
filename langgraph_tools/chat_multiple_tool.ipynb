Chawla, Olaf Wiest, Xiangliang Zhang\\nSummary: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide\\narray of tasks. Due to the impressive planning and reasoning abilities of LLMs,\\nthey have been used as autonomous agents to do many tasks automatically.\\nRecently, based on the development of using one LLM as a single planning or\\ndecision-making agent, LLM-based multi-agent systems have achieved considerable\\nprogress in complex problem-solving and world simulation. To provide the\\ncommunity with an overview of this dynamic field, we present this survey to\\noffer an in-depth discussion on the essential aspects of multi-agent systems\\nbased on LLMs, as well as the challenges. Our goal is for readers to gain\\nsubstantial insights on the following questions: What domains and environments\\ndo LLM-based multi-agents simulate? How are these agents profiled and how do\\nthey communicate? What mechanisms contribute to the growth of agents'\\ncapacities? For those interested in delving into this field of study, we also\\nsummarize the commonly used datasets or benchmarks for them to have convenient\\naccess. To keep researchers updated on the latest studies, we maintain an\\nopen-source GitHub repository, dedicated to outlining the research on LLM-based\\nmulti-agent systems.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-12-21\\nTitle: SubData: A Python Library to Collect and Combine Datasets for Evaluating LLM Alignment on Downstream Tasks\\nAuthors: Leon Fröhling, Pietro Bernardelle, Gianluca Demartini\\nSummary: With the release of ever more capable large language models (LLMs),\\nresearchers in NLP and related disciplines have started to explore the\\nusability of LLMs for a wide variety of different annotation tasks. Very\\nrecently, a lot of this attention has shifted to tasks that are subjective in\\nnature. Given that the latest generations of LLMs have digested and encoded\\nextensive knowledge about different human subpopulations and individuals, the\\nhope is that these models can be trained, tuned or prompted to align with a\\nwide range of different human perspectives. While researchers already evaluate\\nthe success of this alignment via surveys and tests, there is a lack of\\nresources to evaluate the alignment on what oftentimes matters the most in NLP;\\nthe actual downstream tasks. To fill this gap we present SubData, a Python\\nlibrary that offers researchers working on topics related to subjectivity in\\nannotation tasks a convenient way of collecting, combining and using a range of\\nsuitable datasets.\""

      "Summary: Abdul Rashid Salim Salman Khan (pronounced [səlˈmɑːn xɑːn, -kʰɑːn̪]; born 27 December 1965) is an Indian actor, film producer, and television personality who predominantly works in Hindi films. In a career spanning over three decades, his awards include two National Film Awards as a film producer, and two Filmfare Awards as an actor. He has been cited in the media as one of the most popular and commercially successful actors of Indian cinema. Forbes included him in listings of the highest-paid celebrities in the world, in 2015 and 2018, with him being the highest-ranked Indian in the latter year. He has starred in the annual highest-grossing Hindi films of 10 individual years, the highest for any actor.\n",
      "Khan began his acting career with a supporting role in Biwi Ho To Aisi (1988), followed by his breakthrough with a leading role in Sooraj Barjatya's romantic drama Maine Pyar Kiya (1989), for which he was awarded the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut. He established himself with several commercially successful films, including Lawrence D'Souza's romantic drama Saajan (1991), Barjatya's family dramas Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! (1994) and Hum Saath-Saath Hain (1999), the action film Karan Arjun (1995) and the comedy Biwi No.1 (1999). After a period of fluctuations through the 2000s, Khan resurrected his screen image with the action film Wanted (2009), and achieved greater stardom the following decade by starring in the top-grossing action films Dabangg (2010), Ready (2011), Bodyguard (2011), Ek Tha Tiger (2012), Dabangg 2 (2012), Kick (2014), and Tiger Zinda Hai (2017), and the dramas Bajrangi Bhaijaan (2015) and Sultan (2016). This was followed by a series of poorly-received films, with the exception of  Bharat (2019) and the sequel Tiger 3 (2023).\n",
      "In addition to his acting career, Khan is a television presenter and promotes humanitarian causes through his charity, Being Human Foundation. He has been hosting the reality show Bigg Boss since 2010. Khan's off-screen life is marred by controversy and legal troubles. In 2015, he was convicted of culpable homicide for a negligent driving case in which he ran over five people with his car, killing one, but his conviction was set aside on appeal. On 5 April 2018, Khan was convicted in a blackbuck poaching case and sentenced to five years imprisonment. On 7 April 2018, he was out on bail while an appeal was ongoing.\n",

      "Page: Salman Khan filmography\n",
      "Summary: Salman Khan is an Indian actor and producer, known for his work in Hindi films. He made his film debut with a brief role in Biwi Ho To Aisi (1988), before having his breakthrough with Sooraj Barjatya's blockbuster romance Maine Pyar Kiya (1989) that won him the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut. In the early 1990s, he earned success with the action film Baaghi: A Rebel for Love (1990) and the romance Sanam Bewafa, Saajan (both 1991). His other releases during this period failed commercially, resulting in a brief setback in his career.\n",
      "The success of the family drama Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! (1994) and the melodramatic action Karan Arjun (1995) revitalised Khan's career and established him in Bollywood. Also in 1994, he co-starred with Aamir Khan in the comedy movie Andaz Apna Apna, which was poorly received at that time, but later became a cult film in India. Among his three film releases of 1996 were Sanjay Leela Bhansali's critically acclaimed musical drama Khamoshi and the Raj Kanwar-directed drama Jeet. The following year, he played dual roles in David Dhawan's comedy Judwaa. In 1998, Khan featured in Sohail Khan's Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya, and appeared briefly in the romantic drama Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, both of which ranked among the top-earning Bollywood productions of 1998. For the latter, he was awarded the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n",
      "In 1999, Khan starred in three commercially successful productions: the comedy Biwi No.1, the romantic drama Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, and the family drama Hum Saath-Saath Hain. After another string of flops, he earned critical acclaim for playing a scorned lover in the romance Tere Naam and a brief role in the family drama Baghban (both 2003). He went on to star in the top-grossing comedies Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004), No Entry (2005) and Partner (2007). Khan made his television debut by hosting two seasons of the game show 10 Ka Dum (2008–09). Following a series of commercial failures from 2006 to 2008, his career saw a resurgence with the financially successful action films Wanted (2009) and Dabangg (2010). In 2010, Khan began hosting the television game show Bigg Boss, later hosting nine more seasons. He won the National Film Award for Best Children's Film for producing Chillar Party (2011) under Salman Khan Being Human Productions, and starred in the year's top grossers—the action comedies Ready and Bodyguard.\n",
      "Khan's next releases Bodyguard (2011), Ready (2011), Ek Tha Tiger (2012), Dabangg 2 (2012), Kick (2014), Jai Ho (2014), Bajrangi Bhai\n"

      "Summary: Being overweight is having more body fat than is optimally healthy. Being overweight is especially common where food supplies are plentiful and lifestyles are sedentary.\n",
      "As of 2003, excess weight reached epidemic proportions globally, with more than 1 billion adults being either overweight or obese. In 2013, this increased to more than 2 billion. Increases have been observed across all age groups.\n",
      "A healthy body requires a minimum amount of fat for proper functioning of the hormonal, reproductive, and immune systems, as thermal insulation, as shock absorption for sensitive areas, and as energy for future use; however, the accumulation of too much storage fat can impair movement, flexibility, and alter the appearance of the body. Some people are naturally heavier and the body positivity movement has worked to reduce body shaming and improve self-confidence amongst heavierset people.\n",
      "At a basic and fundamental level, the treatments called for are diet and exercise. More extensive treatment may involve support groups like Overeaters Anonymous and mental health treatment. The degree to which treatment is necessary varies culturally and with a medical assessment of an unhealthy weight, treatment has been facilitated by new effective weightloss drugs like Zepbound.\n",

      "Page: Obesity in the United Kingdom\n",
      "Summary: Obesity in the United Kingdom is a significant contemporary health concern, with authorities stating that it is one of the leading preventable causes of death. In February 2016, former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt described rising rates of childhood obesity as a \"national emergency\". The National Childhood Measurement Programme, which measures obesity prevalence among school-age pupils in reception class and year 6, found obesity levels rocketed in both years groups by more than 4 percentage points between 2019–20 and 2020–21, the highest rise since the programme began. Among reception-aged children, those aged four and five, the rates of obesity rose from 9.9% in 2019–20 to 14.4% in 2020–21. By the time they are aged 10 or 11, more than a quarter are obese. In just 12 months, the rate is up from 21% in 2019–20 to 25.5% in 2020–21.\n",
      "Data from the Health Survey for England (HSE) conducted in 2018 indicated that 31% of adults in the England were recognised as clinically obese with a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than 30. 63% of adults were classified as overweight or obese (a body mass index of 25 or above), a 10 percent increase 1993. More than two-thirds of men and 6 in 10 women were overweight or obese. 28% of children aged between 2 and 15 years (inclusive) were overweight of them about 15% of children were obese.\n",
      "Rising levels of obesity are a major challenge to public health. There are expected to be 11 million more obese adults in the UK by 2030, accruing up to 668,000 additional cases of diabetes mellitus, 461,000 cases of heart disease and stroke, 130,000 cases of cancer, with associated medical costs set to increase by £1.9–2.0B per year by 2030. Adult obesity rates have almost quadrupled in the last 25 years.\n",
      "Combining three years of data (2012, 2013, and 2014) Public Health England identified Barnsley, South Yorkshire as the local authority with the highest incidence of adult obesity (BMI greater than 30) with 35.1%. Data from the same study revealed that Doncaster, South Yorkshire was the local authority with the highest overall excess weight with 74.8% of adults (16 years and over) with a BMI greater than 25. In previous Public Health England studies based on 2012 data, Tamworth in Staffordshire had been identified as the fattest town in England with an obesity rate of 30.7%.\n",
